    # "Medieval society celebrated the grandest feast during the dreariest time
    # of year. The two-week period from Christmas Eve to Twelfth Day (January 6)
    # transformed into the longest vacation for workers. The Lord of the manor
    # or castle often gave bonuses of food, clothing, drink and firewood to
    # servants. Houses were decked with holly and ivy, and giant Yule logs were
    # brought in and burned throughout the two-week celebration. New Year's took
    # place during this time and added to the festivities, and "First Gifts"
    # were often exchanged on this day."
