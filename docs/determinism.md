# Determinism and entropy

In general, I'd like to curtail the number of sources of entropy in the game. Ideally, I'd like to keep it to weather, the player, and leave the emergent behaviors of the system to amplify those two sources. 

But there may be some other things that are non-deterministic but don't add entropy to the game in an uncontrolled way.

## Things that promote the feeling of non-determinism

* Map generation
* Weather (in general, but especially extreme weather like: lightning, flooding, land-slides)
* Location of resources (iron, gold, etc) (Can this be determined like water?)
* Emergent things that feel like entropy
    - Pestilence
    - Disease generation source (and distance carried)
    - Loop between bandits and traveling merchants (less merchants, less export sales, more bandits, less merchants)
