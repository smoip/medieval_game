## Little facts and links

* life expectancy was about 40 years
* estimated population in 1086 was 1.5m. Over 9000 fiefs that's about 166 people per village. This grew to 5-7m in the 14th century which is 555-777 per village. 
* early Middle Ages / dark ages: small population, very small towns, small villages, many different kingdoms until early 10th century. 
* Middle Ages: clearing of forests, great expansion of population, feudalism, castle tech greatly increases, towns draw many visitors
* late Middle Ages: population hits high, castle tech peaks, but then the Black Plague and great famine hit reducing population by 40-70%. Overpopulation and poor harvests. Also, mercenaries dominate the field. 
* women would be pregnant 4-8 times and lose at least one child
* 8 weeks of not working, many festivals
* manorialism is the reciprocal agreement between lord and serf to provide use of land for rent or working the lords lands. Feudalism was the reciprocal agreement between lord and King to own land in exchange for military services. 
* england had about 9000 manors/fiefs of between 800-1200 acres. Serfs had several strips of land about 1/2 acre each scattered throughout the demesne totaling 20-40 acres. 15-25% of land was kept for the lord, and another 25% was commons or forest usable by all serfs. 
* yeomen owned their own land and farmed it themselves, but we're required to be trained in bow and sword. Usually 30-150 acres. 
* even petty lords could withstand a royal army when hidden in a proper castle. 
* medieval villages relied on wells for water very often; even and especially inside castle walls. 
* castles could hold 6 months of supplies in their walls. 
* mountains greatly hampered the flow of information and traffic and as such, in Italy for instance, centralized feudalism died quickly because no king could actually conquer the whole realm. So they ended up with city states. 
* 12,264 trees / km^2 (4735.154928 / mi^2) (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/16/the-countries-of-the-world-ranked-by-their-tree-wealth/)
* United Kingdom: 547x640 mi (orig: 438x512px@80px = 100mi)

* a barony, called an honour, consisted of dozens to hundreds of manors and would frequently have a castle at some place the baron favored. These manors were deliberately spread across several shires to prevent any one baron from holding all of one shire. 
* barons were required to attend parliament
* upon death, lands of a tenant-in-chief reverted to the king until the heir could pay a "relief" (fee). This was often a quarter of one years profit or 100quid for a baron, or about 5quid for a knight. 
* 1400 manors were owned by the king directly
* a county sheriff collected taxes, but baronies spanned multiple counties. 
* military obligations for most serfs were limited to 40 days per year, so usually baronial spats (which were frequent)
* serfs were generally content to live their lives, not stretching or moving about. 
* The great empire of Charlemagne was divided at his death (in A.D. 814) among his three sons,--one of whom had France, another Italy, and the third Germany. In forty-five years afterwards we find seven kingdoms, instead of three,--France, Navarre, Provence, Burgundy, Lorraine, Germany, and Italy. In a few years more there were twenty-nine hereditary fiefs. And as early as the tenth century France itself was split up into fifty-five independent sovereignties; and these small sovereignties were again divided into dukedoms and baronies.
* lords generally did not travel much, only the high clergy. England may have been different in this regard, or maybe it was just the king. 
* glass was rare or a later invention, so rooms were either damp and cold, or windowless and still cold. Both in castles and cottages. Children slept on the floor and often cottages only had 1-2 beds. 
* roads were occupied by foot, horses, or covered wagons. When there were roads, which there often were not. 
* in early Middle Ages, towns were small and uninteresting; towns that had a port or an important crossing or even a mine. 
* iron was often produced from bogs, not mines. There was also a refining industry where expert smiths could take crap iron, welded together, and melt/purify it into good strong iron (or steel?)
