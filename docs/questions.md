# Questions

* How to integrate/remove existing player knowledge of the time.
* Innumeracy of reality. How to represent the reality of being a king. 
* core values can't be directly observed, but seen through lens of actions/decisions. Player can nudge group by disapproving/rewarding certain decisions, but the effect is unclear until more decisions are made. 
    - keeping ledgers of decisions is unnatural and impossible for the generally illiterate villagers, so ledgers of decisions only go back so far until more effort is put in place. 
    - leaders and players work to satisfy the same kpi. Hoarding wealth should probably be discouraged, but maybe it's punishment of its own. 
* what is -really- within the power of a medieval governor to control? 
* which buildings make it possible for a ruler to do more? Prior to a court, rulers must arbitrate, but after, they must manage the delegation carefully. What data do they have available to them? Nothing is really limited, but annoyingly difficult to manage. 
* what does a medieval economy really look like?
* is complicated family progression actually interesting to players? What about random new attributes or the training of heirs? Complicated familiar affairs?
* do we handle things like the plague? (Which if we do, we should link it to something other than cleanliness or penicillin)
* do we handle inflation/deflation? 
* external threats only? Or do we consider betrayal or defection as well?
* how are towns/regions conquered? Do we even need dialogs to claim something? Or can we claim towns even as brigands? What does ownership really mean? Do we even need regions? Or is it really down to contiguous areas of land ownership? How did area names even get established?
* turnover of land ownership dramatically affects trade as well as opinion. 
* do we start from a standpoint where there is already a king/queen? An established government and a reasonable system? Or do we start with free land owners?
* what expertise do we need in order to build proper walls? Peasants could build packed earth walls, but probably not straight stone walls, let alone curved stone walls, tall walls, towers, structural walls that don't collapse inner rooms. 
* do we need bankers and usurers? How much was the normal rate?
* how much would it matter if someone can't read?
* do we need to support alternative forms of government like republics? Or should we just stick with feudalism?
* how does communication of info actually happen? Carrier pigeons? (Processions/Prayers before battle were info, delivered to people by priests. Messengers were a permanent part of the budget. It took about a month for comms to reach a whole kingdom) Also, this required that the messengers knew the info, and possibly scribes, so trust was important. 
* What is the actual game here? Is the goal to manage a village well, grow to town, then city, take over more land, etc? Is it even possible to conquer all of England without extreme tedium?
* How much does magic play into this game?
* How much do we want the clergy to play into this? It's a complicated extra thing, but it could be interesting
* How does one become royalty? [For kings I think you just off another king and claim it, for Earls/Marquess', seems to have happened in the 500s when Roman power subsided and ealdormen realized that they didn't need to send taxes to Rome anymore]
* Should kings be allowed to rename and reorder titles in arbitrary fashion? What about land-ownership or other rights? [probably not worth doing in v1]
* How flexible do we want to be with taxation? Should we allow taxation on the sale of certain goods? % of harvest? based on land size? only exports? size of community? What about reductions for the number of standing soldiers? Can we actually define all the things that are taxable, and then create an AI that tries to game the system? And how does this affect the AI's perception of the king, or satisfaction? Can we find a way for the AI to "invent" smuggling?
* How much does an individual need to earn in order to live? Can this be actively modeled and monitored?
* How long should AI memory last? If they're attacked, should they always have a negative feeling towards others? If they're feeling negative, should they restrict trading?
* how does a person decide if they should be jealous? Or even what items would make them happy?
