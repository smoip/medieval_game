# Random fun thoughts

* Capture the flag with villages. 
* might be good to start earlier, like 700ad. This would allow us to go from the early dark ages, through the expansions, and watch castle tech and economic tech flourish. 
* arms race with castle tech
* Has to start with simpler structures like earthen walls or motte and Bailey
* Trade offs, can't build the wall too large, but also can't afford to lose too many buildings
* City should have some options to grow on its own if economy is handled well
* at some point, needs to support towns with thousands of residents (100k?)
* must support fairly arbitrary ownership and taxation ai/policies
* religions should not be the same as on earth, nor should the land masses, but I'm okay with the numeric system and the monetary systems being simple representations
* economy must automatically model commodity flooding, source/sink, and travelers
* weather should have huge impact on the economy. This is a key randomizer for the game
* banditry/poaching should be an effect of homelessness
* governors and local leaders should be able to help report about the towns/city sections under your care, but they also require management
* rent goes up near important things
* all humans start with full Maslows needs, but rebellion needs to require more than unhappiness, there needs to be a hope of better. 
* I want main char to be a person, but I don't want a Mount&Blade clone
* when an area is conquered, the local lords may get replaced by the new king including all lands owned. 
* castles need secret passageways, both hidden exits and secret ways through the castle. 
* sieges need to support pestilences, but also large stocks of goods, tunneling, etc. 
* sieges also require that we understand differing levels of land. Siege towers only work on level ground for instance. 
* generally, we want to see the outside of a building, and generally buildings are one story, one room. But when we get to keeps and concentric castles, we'll need to have the ability to look "in" the keeps at different floors. (Should we see only one floor at a time? Or explode it so we can see all floors at once?)
* since castles are so damned hard to deal with, assassination must be an integral part of the game. AI should understand this and take different strategies. 
* AI needs to possess a full decision tree for many events, but many paths are not possible. "Randomness" of decision should be provided by differing inputs, complex enough that it feels hard to game, but is in fact mostly deterministic.  
* patrolling behavior needs to feel natural and obvious. It shouldn't require complicated setup, but it should be pretty much required. 
* we need a way to show a "fog of war" for information; we shouldn't know what's happening at a remote village if neither the main char nor their allies are anywhere nearby. This also needs a straightforward mechanic to manage information flow. (What could you use to observe the state of your country from within your castle? You might see smoke, but not individual horses and peasants) Weather also greatly affected this as messengers could not travel well in rain or snow. Also, they could be killed. (Pigeons could cover 20 days walk in a day)
* armies must have supply lines. They should forage from the country side, but the point of a castle is to prevent armies from moving on because their lines would be vulnerable. 
* when you retreat for a siege, move everything into the walls and burn the fields. 
* contracts and treaties seem to be one of he most important aspects of the medieval times. I don't know how this fits into a game at all. 
* rgba would be a great map storage format. One channel for terrain height (fixed water level), then three other channels for whatever else. At 1024x1024 we would require a really good interpolation/terrain scatter to make the map look reasonable. That would be about 1 mile per pixel. 10k would be much better, but I know we can't load that texture directly. 
* we're going to need a hellishly good random name generator if we have 9000 fiefs, n rivers, etc. 
* timber needs to be a regenerating resource that can be whittled down to nothing with enough work. 
* we may need to consider having boats or foreign lands from which to export
* we need to have time control from very early with a way to quickly break warp
