# Goal

Manage a beautiful and natural looking domain against a litany of threats like famine, betrayal, regicide, or intelligent enemies bent on your destruction, and emerge victorious through planning and foresight, rather than fast reactions or cheap hacks against bad combat ai. 

## Core tenants 

If these aren't here, it will not be fun for me

* The world MUST run itself absent the player's influence. The player and the weather are the only ongoing sources of entropy. 
* The world MUST be real scale, with appropriate mechanisms to manage that complexity and models appropriate to agent behavior (including innovative battle ai)
* The world MUST not punish a player for their in-game gender, sexuality, race

## Core assumptions 

Everything in my head is built on these, if they're untrue, we need to fix it

* Being a monarch is unimaginably complicated and difficult
* There are generally not evil people in the world, outside of sociopaths; but there are people who are not aligned with your interests
* Related, generally lords will try to do their best to treat their serfs well, for some definition of well
* A player's existing knowledge of the world is not particularly helpful in most cases. Given enough money, resources, and time, this knowledge can be used. It is assumed that the player will try to use this knowledge and should be successful in some way, but not a game breaking way. 
* Agents act in a predictable and rational way, by maximizing their kpi via their core values with the available resources at hand. 
* Communication and data flow is a much larger problem than people understand these days
* All genders and sexualities are perfectly fine and equal in this world. 
* Anyone can become a noble or even king via some means, no rule/law should prevent this. 
* The economy must behave realistically, though not necessarily the way a player would expect. 
* The game is won through research, learning, hard work, and planning. Not through fast acting twitch gaming
