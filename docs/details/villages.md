## Description of farms

## Manors

* usually between 800-1200 acres
* villages were about 100 tenants, or about 500-600 people
* 45% held 1ha, 31% held 5-7ha, 22% held 10-13ha. (4ha needed per family)
* arable land divided into 3, one for spring, one for fall, one fallow (and grazing)
* Barley/Oats/Legumes in one field, Rye/Wheat in another (Wheat was a cash crop, only the rich ate wheat bread)
* barley, wheat, lesser amounts of oats, peas, beans, rye, flax, apples, and vegetables
* pigs (food), sheep (wool, cash crop), cattle, horses, oxen, and poultry

## How does a village expand population

* Births (lots!)
* infantry returning home
* outsiders settling down (ex-bandits, etc)
* marriages
* ultimately, quality of harvest, lack of military distress, etc. 

## How does a village contract

* old age
* disease, infection
* taking the Kings coin
* becoming a bandit, debtors prison
* going to town to work
* going to a mine/etc to work
* marriages
* arrested
* raiders
* taking vows
* general death (accidents, hunting, bandits, etc)

## How does a village expand its demesne

* lord buys lands from neighbor
* new fields plowed from rugged terrain
* neighboring village collapses leaving unclaimed lands
* new technology allows new land to be recovered
* a villager becomes rich enough to hire workers and plow more fields or buy new fields
* cutting down nearby forests for farmland

## What a town should try to do

* at all times, try to maintain a reasonable stockpile (for some def of reasonable)
* plant as many fields as possible, balancing cash crops and sustenance crops
* harvest the fields and sell off any excess to peddlers
* clear/plow new fields if possible and they can be maintained (while maintaining some portion of woods and pasture for grazing and hunting)
* make secondary and finished goods for sale and for stockpiling
* celebrate, and entertain themselves
* get married, have kids, care for each other
* go to church
* hire people to work the fields (kids and young adults who don't own any land of their own through inheritance and don't work their parents' land)
* hire oxen drivers to plow the fields (there was often only a few per village, so they had to share, but I don't think they were free)
* plan for how to pay the 'entry fee' during succession. 1 sheep for a half-virgate, 1 cow for a full virgate. Eldest son would inherit, get married, but younger sons would work, apprentice, study to be a monk, go to town, or become a soldier. (https://www.quora.com/In-the-Middle-Ages-did-serfs-and-commoners-marry-often-and-did-they-do-so-strategically-like-nobles)
* works the lords' land (if there was a lord)
