# Game

## Story mode

* start out as a young person, gifted with a clarity of purpose that nobody else seems to have
* no land, no money, no prestige
* via a series of choices, your village grows or dies out. Several important things happen to shape the village and challenge their resolve (bandits, war, famine, pestilence, foul magic, etc)
* eventually character becomes the village elder, or a traveling merchant, or a warrior, or etc. but a leader in some way. 
* 'As the new dawn sun rises and washes the walls of your families cottage, you sit up in bed and scratch a nagging itch on your scalp. What a strange dream, it felt very long, like an entire lifetime lived in the future. Flicking a small black bug off your finger you think, "huh, fleas. I could fix that if I vacuum the house and wash all my clothes at the laundry." Squinting you find yourself wondering what a vacuum is; and even how you know that the bug is called a flea. You have been given a singular vision of the future, a state of prosperity which you can barely comprehend, yet you know it is possible. What else did you learn last night, and how much of it can you teach without people accusing you of being a witch and burning you?'
* another possibility: helping the kingdom out of antiquity and guiding the world towards the enlightenment.
